&{Tips: To move up its commits, git offers the command {comment-strong}git reset{/comment-strong}.}

&{By using {comment-strong}git reset --hard{/comment-strong} followed by the commit id, git will remove everything that happened after in the current branch.}
&{Be careful. This is a dangerous command, it's not possible to go back after.}
