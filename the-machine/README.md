# MemoryOverflow - The Machine

The machine is an artificial intelligence designed by the Developer Master before his death. Her goal is to find a worthy successor to the D.M. fighting the horde of developers who think they're smart enought.

The Machine has designed special agents who work for her. Each is responsible for a particular task, such as cards or website generations for example.

As a contributor, you will need to launch The Machine to update the content with your changes. Don't be afraid. The Machine is smart as hell. In constant discussion with her agents, she will automatically knows that you've made changes and will update the specific parts of the project alone.

The Machine sees everything.

## How to start The Machine

Easy peasy guys. Do you know <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>? Start by installing it on your system. It's small and fast. Really, try it. Already done? I'd told you.

So now, follow theses simples steps:

1. Clone this repository project on your system
2. Start your command line tool, like the _Terminal_ for Mac/Linux or _cmd_ for Windows.
3. Go to the directory ```the-machine```
4. Start Node Package Manager to install The Machine dependencies with this command:
```
npm install
```

Fantastic, The Machine is installed on your computer. Now, each time you want to use it, just start this command:
```
npm start
```
She will start to speak with its special agents and will generate cards and website.

The Machine really likes you.
