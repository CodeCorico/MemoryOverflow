# MemoryOverflow - Story of The Machine

Few weeks ago, the biggest of all the developers died. A huge space filled the world as we know it. Known as the biggest computer genius of all time, this engineer had turned the digital technology era to the quantum era in just a few years. There is no developer on earth who doesn't know its story as well as each of its inventions. And there is no human being who isn'tt using his products every day. Aerospace, military, home automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and some more other emergent sectors took a burst of acceleration these last few years thanks to the technological advances of the man known as the **Developer Master**.

According to his testament, he wanted to share with the developers's world a letter he wrote shortly before his death. This letter is the last testimony he has left to us. It's a part of his soul.

> "My dear developer friends,
>
> My whole life was devoted to computer engineering. I have traveled the world and learned to use each technology within our planet. And the more I learned, the more I discovered the wonders of the human brain.
>
> During one of my trips, I discovered the essence of human intelligence. How it works, evolves and learns from his mistakes. Every cell in our body, every neuron in our brain, every psychological behavior, everything can be digitally reproduced! Unfortunately, the more I was traveling the more I was getting older. I've come to realize over time how our human bodies are weak and limited.
>
> So I designed a new kind of machine. A machine that would be similar to humans. Instead of serving, she would be like them, smart. So I could fill her with all my intelligence and knowledge. I will continue to live even after my physical death.
>
> The Machine was born 4 years ago. 4 years that I build her, hidden from the rest of the world. For once, I chose not to put her under an Open Source license. I am close to the end, there is only a small problem to solve.
>
> Since I do not want The Machine to fall into the wrong hands, I developed the most effective security system ever built. **Only a Developer Master can enter The Machine** by finding the correct security code.
>
> As Arthur's sword stuck in the rock, I leave you all the time to find the code and prove you're worthy of a **Developer Master**. The one who cracks the code will become the best developer in the world and control the entire machine.
>
> As I said earlier, I have a "small" problem to start the machine. I must have to transfer within all the vital energy of my brain. I'm not completely sure on the side effects it could have on me, but as I am a man of science, I will try it very soon.
>
> Actually, if you read this letter, it means that I've tried. I hope everything has gone well.
>
> D.M."
